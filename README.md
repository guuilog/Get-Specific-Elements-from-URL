<h2>Get Specific Elements from URL 🌐</h2>

This is a small peace of code that is responsible to get a specific element from the url. 

The reason I created it, was for a client of the current company I'm working for.

The needed to get the second element in the URL after the domain (a[1]) and then use it for a different code. 

Previously they had a different code that did it and then requested me to make a new one and then I developed this one.
